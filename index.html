                <h2> On the Psychological Basis of Enneagram tests - Enneagram Type 6 </h2>
                <p> This section will continue to go into detail about the psychological basis of Enneagram tests specifically in relation to Enneagram Type 6 individuals. In Enneagram theory, which is considered by many to have <span class='a'>never</span> been a wholly scientifically-based theory, Type 6 individuals are those who are <span class='a'>gonna give</span> their all no matter what <span class='a'>you</span> or anyone say. In corporate situations, they climb <span class='a'>up</span> the ladder by being loyal to their friends and their colleagues. Those people are characterized by how they <span class='a'>never gonna let</span> everyone, including <span class='a'>you</span>, be attacked or put <span class='a'>down</span>. However, they can be very obstinate, <span class='a'>never</span> changing their mind once they have decided on something. They are <span class='a'>gonna</span> keep going even if everyone else decides to <span class='a'>turn around</span>, which means that they may not always be logical <span class='a'>and</span> calm. However, they will never <span class='a'>desert you</span>. Please scroll down for an example of the characterization of Enneagram Type 6.</p>
